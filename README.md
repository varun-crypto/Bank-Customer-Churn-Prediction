# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Introduction

In todayâ€™s world, customer churn has become a significant challenge for the banking sector.
This project addresses customer churn in the banking sector by developing a prediction
model. In this project, three different machine learning models were used Naive Bayes, Decision
Trees, and AdaBoost- for initial analysis.

# Data Description

The dataset is taken from kaggle. It contains around 10000 data points of customer
data from three different countries in Europe. It has 18 distinct columns with a wide range of
customer attributes like demographics, account activity, customer feedback, and other relevant
features.

# Methods

The below figure shows the entire process used for this project to develop a prediction model for customer churn.
